  "description": "OpenMud is a freely available and fully open source text-based MMO game. It's a passion project of mine and something that I intend to do to keep me entertained in my spare time. I have some pretty grand ideas for how I'd like to develop this game, but at first I will be starting small. During development, I will do my best to keep a development blog outlining what my plans are and how I approach problems.",
