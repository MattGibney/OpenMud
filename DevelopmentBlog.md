Hello, I am working on a MUD (Multi User Dungeon). It's a text-based online
multi player adventure game. Players can work alone or as part of a group to go
on grand adventures, epic quests, grind out skills or work together to acheive
something entirelly new.

## Introduction (Friday 16th July 2021)

Honestly, I have no idea at this point how many times I have started to work on
a project like this. I really want to make a MUD but I really don't know what
the best way is to approach this from. I've had a go at some of the traditional
telnet based approaches. I've tried websockets and fancy browser UIs. The issue
has never really been in getting the technology to work, that's easy. I have
always struggled to get the feeling right.

Ultimately, whatever game I make, it's never going to be played by a lot of
people. Text-based games are already a really niche area and there are plenty of
big games that have been around for a really long time with decades of content.
No, these projects have always been about me experimenting with new ways of
approaching the problem and all have had the pros and cons. I'd happily write
something in the future describing my different approaches if there is interest,
so let me know.

So what about this project? Why am I making this one? What is the goal? As
stated above, my promary motivation has historically been about the technology.
I had an idea and wanted to know how it would work. This time is different. This
time, I want to actually make a game. I want to produce something that can
actually be played and enjoyed. I don't really have a grand vision for a game at
the moment, I don't even have a theme. All I really have at this point is a
desire to create something that's fun to play for myself, and hopefully others
too.

One thing that I feel sets this game apart from many others is that I will be
keeping 100% of the game open source. The code will be freely available forever.
I have no intention of ever making any money from this project, it's strictly a
passion project. By being open source, I hope that other developers can find my
implementation of features interesting. I will also be heavily encouraging
players to make improvements or bug fixes to the code if they feel comfortable
doing so.

To begin with, I will be working on what I consider to be a minimum viable
product. The features will be incredibly limited, but they will be a good
starting point for me to build from. I have created a series of "issues" within
Github to represent the required development work for this MVP
[Milestone](https://github.com/Moppler/OpenMud/milestone/1).
