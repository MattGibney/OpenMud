# OpenMud

OpenMud is a freely available and fully open source text-based MMO game. It's a
passion project of mine and something that I intend to do to keep me entertained
in my spare time. I have some pretty grand ideas for how I'd like to develop
this game, but at first I will be starting small. During development, I will do
my best to keep a development blog outlining what my plans are and how I
approach problems.

## World Building

I am not a writer, nor am I a world builder. It's very likely that the world I
build for this game will be un-inspired and a littel clich√©. That being said,
i'll always do my best; hopefully along the way i'll get the attention of some
passionate world-builders who want to help me out in my endeavour.
